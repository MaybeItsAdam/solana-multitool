# This file ensures the out/ directory structure is preserved in git
# while the actual output files are ignored via .gitignore
#
# The out/ directory contains generated files from the Raydium project:
# - logs/: Application logs
# - transactions/: Transaction data (error_txs/, working_txs/)
# - pool_scans/: Pool creation scan results
# - swap_data/: Swap analysis data
# - raw_data/: Debug and raw blockchain data
#
# These directories will be created automatically by output_manager.py
# when the application runs, but this file ensures the base out/ directory
# exists in the repository.
