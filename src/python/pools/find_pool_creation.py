"""
Simple CLI tool to find Raydium pool creation transactions.

‚ö†Ô∏è  LIMITATIONS:
- Only works for Raydium pools that have valid 'openTime' data in their API response
- Many older pools have openTime = 0 or missing openTime field
- Newer pools (created after ~2023) are more likely to work
- If openTime is missing/invalid, you must provide manual epoch timestamp

Usage:
    python find_pool_creation.py <pool_address> [open_time_epoch]

Examples:
    # Auto-fetch from API (works only if pool has valid openTime)
    python find_pool_creation.py 58oQChx4yWmvKdwLLZzBi4ChoCc2fqCUWBkwMihLYQo2
    
    # Manual timestamp (required for pools with openTime = 0)
    python find_pool_creation.py POOL_ADDRESS 1703123456

Requires openTime to be a field on the pool obtained from raydium's api
